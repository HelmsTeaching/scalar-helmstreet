## Scalar overview
Make a digital book!
So much easier than HTML!
Heres the exercise we’re doing.

## Assignment
Make an exhibition about a topic you’re interested in. Maybe this is the beginning of your final project!

Must include: 
- Visual/conceptual Theme
- At least four pieces of media
- At least four pages

Start by drawing and writing on PAPER!
1. Once you’ve got some ideas, start gathering the media you’d like to showcase. 
    - I like Internet Archive for this step.
3. Then create pages with short narratives/arguments. 
4. Add Scalar links to the media throughout.
5. Create pathways so there’s an organizational scheme.
6. Add a TOC 
    - (it’s under properties). 
7. Make sure to make it visible without signing in! 
    - (also under properties)
9. Post a link to it as a readme.md file in your github
